parts:
  - id: abstract
    description: >
      The abstract should be a single paragraph of no more than 250 words.
      It should explain to the general reader the major contributions of the
      article. References in the abstract must be cited in full within the
      abstract itself and cited in the text.
  - id: summary
    max_words: 120
    description: >
      A 120-word maximum statement about the significance of the research,
      written at a level understandable to an undergraduate educated scientist
      outside their field of speciality.
  - id: firstpage
    title: Main text content to place on first page
    description: >
      The PNAS template uses a special wide-column layout for the first page,
      and for this it needs to know where the first page’s contents end –
      to know where to insert the commands which reset to the default layout.
  - id: matmethods
    description: >
      Use this part to describe your materials and methods. This can be more
      than one paragraph, and may contain subsections and equations as required.
  - id: acknowledgments
    description: >
      Acknowledgments should form a single paragraph.
      Please do not include any acknowledgments in the Supporting Information,
      or anywhere else in the manuscript.
  - id: author_contributions
    description: >
      Provide details of author contributions here, for example
      "A and B conceived the research project. A performed the experiments
      and analysis. A and B wrote the manuscript together."
      This is the same information as in the `roles` field, but in full
      sentences.
  - id: declaration
    description: >
      Declare here any competing interests.

    description: >
      The PNAS template has variants for “short” and “long” articles, with
      slight layout differences. For example, for short articles the abstract
      is placed within the first column, while for long articles it is placed
      above the main text, in a wide paragraph spanning the entire page width.
      (These variants are in addition to the three types `research_article`,
      `mathematics` and `invited`.)
  - id: single_column
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: >
      The PNAS template has variants for single and double column layouts.
  - id: template_type
    type: choice
    choices:
      - research_article
      - mathematics
      - invited
    default: research_article
    description: >
      The PNAS template defines three types `research_article`, `mathematics`
      and `invited`. By far the most common is `research_article`; authors who
      should use one of the other types likely know this already. +
      research_article: Two-column research article + mathematics: One-column
      mathematics article + invited: PNAS invited submission
  # - id: firstpagepars
  #   title: First paragraph of second page
  #   type: string
  #   max_chars: 2
  #   default: "2"
  #   description: >
  #     Use `firstpagepars` to indicate which paragraph will start the second page
  #     and subsequent formatting. Heading levels count as paragraphs. For
  #     example, if there are 11 paragraphs on the first page (counting the first
  #     level heading) as a paragraph, then you should provide `firstpagepars=12`
  #     since the second page starts on the 12-the paragraph. You can leave this
  #     value unset during writing and only adjust it during the manuscript’s
  #     final preparation stage.
  # - id: firstpagelines
  #   title: First line of second page
  #   type: string
  #   max_chars: 3
  #   description: >
  #     If a paragraph runs over from the first to the second page, use
  #     `firstpagelines` to indicate the paragraph line number starting the second
  #     page. E.g. if the first three lines of the 11-th paragraph appear on the
  #     first page, provide `firstpagelines=4`. This value is optional (by default
  #     formatting assumes that the second page starts with the beginning of a
  #     paragraph). You can leave this value unset during writing and only adjust
  #     it, if necessary, during the manuscript’s final preparation stage.
  - id: leftbibitems
    title: No. of bibliography items in left column
    type: string
    max_chars: 2
    description: >
      The bibliography is formatted in two columns starting immediately below
      the main text. Use this option to specify how many items to include before
      that first column break.
